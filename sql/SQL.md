### Counting with `CASE WHEN`, number of games for each season by country
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count matches in each of the 3 seasons
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2012_2013,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```
### Counting: `CASE WHEN` with multiple conditions
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Sum the total records in each season where the home team won
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2012_2013,
 	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```
### Count each outcome by country: home win, away win, tie...
```sql
SELECT 
    c.name AS country,
    -- Count the home wins, away wins, and ties in each country
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS home_wins,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS away_wins,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS ties
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
### Calculate percentage of matches tied with `CASE WHEN`
- Unrounded
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Calculate the percentage of tied games in each season
	AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal <> m.away_goal THEN 0
			END) AS ties_2013_2014,
	AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal <> m.away_goal THEN 0
			END) AS ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
- Rounded: 2 decimal points
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Round the percentage of tied games to 2 decimal points
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal <> m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal <> m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
### Subqueries
```sql
SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goals, and away goals scored
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM  matches_2013_2014
-- Filter for matches where total goals exceeds 3x the average
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) > 
       (SELECT 3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
        FROM matches_2013_2014);
```
### Return teams with 8 or more goals as home teams
```sql
SELECT
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Filter for teams with 8 or more home goals
WHERE team_api_id IN
	  (SELECT hometeam_id 
       FROM match
       WHERE home_goal >= 8);
```
### Joining Subqueries in `FROM`
```sql
SELECT
	-- Select country name and the count match IDs
    c.name AS country_name,
    COUNT(sub.id) AS matches
FROM country AS c
-- Inner join the subquery onto country
-- Select the country id and match id columns
INNER JOIN (SELECT country_id, id 
           FROM match
           -- Filter the subquery by matches with 10+ goals
           WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10) AS sub
ON c.id = sub.country_id
GROUP BY country_name;
```
### 
```sql
SELECT
	-- Select country, date, home, and away goals from the subquery
    country,
    date,
    home_goal,
    away_goal
FROM 
	-- Select country name, date, home_goal, away_goal, and total goals in the subquery
	(SELECT c.name AS country, 
     	    m.date, 
     		m.home_goal, 
     		m.away_goal,
           (m.home_goal + m.away_goal) AS total_goals
    FROM match AS m
    LEFT JOIN country AS c
    ON m.country_id = c.id) AS subq
-- Filter by total goals scored in the main query
WHERE total_goals >= 10;
```
### `SELECT` clause subquery
```sql
SELECT 
	l.name AS league,
    -- Select and round the league's total goals
    ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal), 2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Select & round the average total goals for the season
    (SELECT ROUND(AVG(home_goal + away_goal), 2) 
     FROM match
     WHERE season = '2013/2014') AS overall_avg
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Filter for the 2013/2014 season
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY league;
```
```sql
SELECT
	-- Select the league name and average goals scored
	l.name AS league,
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal),2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Subtract the overall average from the league average
	ROUND(AVG(m.home_goal + m.away_goal) -
		(SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
		 FROM match 
         WHERE season = '2013/2014'),2) AS diff
FROM league AS l
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON l.country_id = m.country_id
-- Only include 2013/2014 results
WHERE season = '2013/2014'
GROUP BY l.name;
```
```sql
SELECT 
	-- Select the stage and average goals from s
	stage,
    ROUND(s.avg_goals,2) AS avg_goal,
    -- Select the overall average for 2012/2013
    (SELECT AVG(home_goal + away_goal) FROM match WHERE season = '2012/2013') AS overall_avg
FROM 
	-- Select the stage and average goals in 2012/2013 from match
	(SELECT
		 stage,
         AVG(home_goal + away_goal) AS avg_goals
	 FROM match
	 WHERE season = '2012/2013'
	 GROUP BY stage) AS s
WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query using the subquery
	s.avg_goals > (SELECT AVG(home_goal+ away_goal) 
                    FROM match WHERE season = '2012/2013');
```
### Basic Correlated Subqueries
```sql
SELECT 
	-- Select country ID, date, home, and away goals from match
	main.country_id,
    main.date,
    main.home_goal, 
    main.away_goal
FROM match AS main
WHERE 
	-- Filter the main query by the subquery
	(home_goal + away_goal) > 
        (SELECT AVG((sub.home_goal + sub.away_goal) * 3)
         FROM match AS sub
         -- Join the main query to the subquery in WHERE
         WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id);
```
### Correlated subquery with multiple conditions
```sql
SELECT 
	-- Select country ID, date, home, and away goals from match
	main.country_id,
    main.date,
    main.home_goal,
    main.away_goal
FROM match AS main
WHERE 
	-- Filter for matches with the highest number of goals scored
	(home_goal + away_goal) = 
        (SELECT MAX(sub.home_goal + sub.away_goal)
         FROM match AS sub
         WHERE main.country_id = sub.country_id
               AND main.season = sub.season);
```
### Nested simple subqueries
```sql
SELECT
	-- Select the season and max goals scored in a match
	season,
    MAX(home_goal + away_goal) AS max_goals,
    -- Select the overall max goals scored in a match
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal) FROM match) AS overall_max_goals,
   -- Select the max number of goals scored in any match in July
   (SELECT MAX(home_goal + away_goal)
    FROM match
    WHERE id IN (
          SELECT id FROM match WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM date) = 07)) AS july_max_goals
FROM match
GROUP BY season;
```
```sql
-- Count match ids
SELECT
    country_id,
    season,
    COUNT(id) AS matches
-- Set up and alias the subquery
FROM 
	(SELECT
    	country_id,
    	season,
    	id
	FROM match
	WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5)
    AS subquery
-- Group by country_id and season
GROUP BY country_id, season;
```
### Nest a subquery in `FROM`
```sql
SELECT
	c.name AS country,
    -- Calculate the average matches per season
	AVG(outer_s.matches) AS avg_seasonal_high_scores
FROM country AS c
-- Left join outer_s to country
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT country_id, season,
         COUNT(id) AS matches
  FROM (
    SELECT country_id, season, id
	FROM match
	WHERE home_goal >= 5 OR away_goal >= 5) AS inner_s
  -- Close parentheses and alias the subquery
  GROUP BY country_id, season) AS outer_s
ON c.id = outer_s.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
```sql
-- Name the CTE
WITH cte AS  
-- Write a regular SQL statement
-- inside parentheses 
  (
    SELECT col1, col2
    FROM table)
-- "Feed" the CTE into a second query
SELECT
  AVG(col1) AS avg_col
FROM cte;
```
```sql
-- Set up your CTE
WITH match_list AS (
    SELECT 
  		country_id, 
  		id
    FROM match
    WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) >= 10)
-- Select league and count of matches from the CTE
SELECT
    l.name AS league,
    COUNT(match_list.id) AS matches
FROM league AS l
-- Join the CTE to the league table
LEFT JOIN match_list ON l.id = match_list.country_id
GROUP BY l.name;
```
