### Counting with `CASE WHEN`, number of games for each season by country
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Count matches in each of the 3 seasons
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2012_2013,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' THEN m.id END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```
### Counting: `CASE WHEN` with multiple conditions
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Sum the total records in each season where the home team won
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2012/2013' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2012_2013,
 	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2013/2014' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2013_2014,
	SUM(CASE WHEN m.season = '2014/2015' AND m.home_goal > m.away_goal
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS matches_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN match AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
-- Group by country name alias
GROUP BY country;
```
### Count each outcome by country: home win, away win, tie...
```sql
SELECT 
    c.name AS country,
    -- Count the home wins, away wins, and ties in each country
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal > m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS home_wins,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal < m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS away_wins,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN m.id 
        END) AS ties
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
### Calculate percentage of matches tied with `CASE WHEN`
- Unrounded
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Calculate the percentage of tied games in each season
	AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal <> m.away_goal THEN 0
			END) AS ties_2013_2014,
	AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal <> m.away_goal THEN 0
			END) AS ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
- Rounded: 2 decimal points
```sql
SELECT 
	c.name AS country,
    -- Round the percentage of tied games to 2 decimal points
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2013/2014' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2013_2014,
	ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal = m.away_goal THEN 1
			 WHEN m.season='2014/2015' AND m.home_goal != m.away_goal THEN 0
			 END),2) AS pct_ties_2014_2015
FROM country AS c
LEFT JOIN matches AS m
ON c.id = m.country_id
GROUP BY country;
```
